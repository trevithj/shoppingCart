## React Practical Task Brief
# Objective:

Write a basic shopping cart in React and Redux.

# Supplied:

Products in an array (these do not require any editing).
```
const products = [
{
name: “Sledgehammer”,
price: 125.75
},
{
name: “Axe”,
price: 190.50
},
{
name: “Bandsaw”,
price: 562.13
},{
name: “Chisel”,
price: 12.9
},
{
name: “Hacksaw”,
price: 18.45
}
]
```

# Requirements:

• The cart will need to keep it’s state during page loads / refreshes
• List Products – these should be listed at all times to allow adding of
products
• Products should be listed in this format: product name, price, link to add
product
• Must be able to add a product to the cart
• Must be able to view current products in the cart
• Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove link
• Product totals should be tallied to give an overall total
• Must be able to remove a product from the cart
• Adding an existing product will only update existing cart product quantity
(e.g. adding the same product twice will NOT create two cart items)
• All prices should be displayed to 2 decimal places

# Misc

• Error checking will be set to strict for viewing completed code
• Project will work as expected with the latest version of React
• Use best practices
• This task should take 1-2 hours max.
